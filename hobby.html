        <p div style="font-family: 'Acme', sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">I love books. Reading enables me to discover different kind of worlds which one lifetime would not have been enough I were to discover all of them in real life. I read almost about everything but I have preferences for romantic novels or spiritual books written in the English language. For me, reading is a way of life. A day without reading is a day gone waste. Reading improves my writing skills since I am exposed to a range of vocabulary and expressions which I usually use in my school essays. I love discovering new words and learning about new things. When I start reading a book, I usually forget around me and enter the book. Each word transports me into the journey that the book has to offer.</p>

        <p div style="font-family: 'Acme', sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">Baking was my way of relaxing. I loved the smile and peopleâ€™s faces when they taste my dessert, and it gave me a strong push to come up with something better. I also love the feeling when I pull something out from the oven, it turned out to be something fluffy and just perfect for everyone. I loved the compliments I get from mum and dad anytime I bake something extraordinary. Each time I bake, I feel a spark of joy in my soul. It felt like I was born to mix flour and make magic from it. I have other hobbies, no doubt, but none can compare to my love for baking.</p>
